SQL Lesson 11: Queries with aggregates (Pt. 2)

Our queries are getting fairly complex, but we have nearly introduced all the important parts of a `SELECT` query. One thing that you might have noticed is that if the `GROUP BY` clause is executed after the `WHERE` clause (which filters the rows which are to be grouped), then how exactly do we filter the grouped rows?

Luckily, SQL allows us to do this by adding an additional `HAVING` clause which is used specifically with the `GROUP BY` clause to allow us to filter grouped rows from the result set.

Select query with HAVING constraint

```sql
SELECT group_by_column, AGG_FUNC(column_expression) AS aggregate_result_alias, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING group_condition;
```

The `HAVING` clause constraints are written the same way as the `WHERE` clause constraints, and are applied to the grouped rows. With our examples, this might not seem like a particularly useful construct, but if you imagine data with millions of rows with different properties, being able to apply additional constraints is often necessary to quickly make sense of the data.
