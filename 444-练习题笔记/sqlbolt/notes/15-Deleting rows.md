SQL Lesson 15: Deleting rows

When you need to delete data from a table in the database, you can use a `DELETE` statement, which describes the table to act on, and the rows of the table to delete through the `WHERE` clause.

Delete statement with condition

```sql
DELETE FROM mytable
WHERE condition;
```

If you decide to leave out the `WHERE` constraint, then _all_ rows are removed, which is a quick and easy way to clear out a table completely (if intentional).

## Taking extra care

Like the `UPDATE` statement from last lesson, it's recommended that you run the constraint in a `SELECT` query first to ensure that you are removing the right rows. Without a proper backup or test database, it is downright easy to irrevocably remove data, so always read your `DELETE` statements twice and execute once.
