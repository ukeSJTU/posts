SQL Lesson 9: Queries with expressions

In addition to querying and referencing raw column data with SQL, you can also use _expressions_ to write more complex logic on column values in a query. These expressions can use mathematical and string functions along with basic arithmetic to transform values when the query is executed, as shown in this physics example.

Example query with expressions

```sql
SELECT particle_speed / 2.0 AS half_particle_speed
FROM physics_data
WHERE ABS(particle_position) * 10.0 > 500;
```

Each database has its own supported set of mathematical, string, and date functions that can be used in a query, which you can find in their own respective docs.

The use of expressions can save time and extra post-processing of the result data, but can also make the query harder to read, so we recommend that when expressions are used in the `SELECT` part of the query, that they are also given a descriptive _alias_ using the `AS` keyword.

Select query with expression aliases

```sql
SELECT col_expression AS expr_description, …
FROM mytable;
```

In addition to expressions, regular columns and even tables can also have aliases to make them easier to reference in the output and as a part of simplifying more complex queries.

Example query with both column and table name aliases

```sql
SELECT column AS better_column_name, …
FROM a_long_widgets_table_name AS mywidgets
INNER JOIN widget_sales
  ON mywidgets.id = widget_sales.widget_id;
```
